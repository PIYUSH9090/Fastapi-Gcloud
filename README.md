We already seen this repo now we are in just diffrent branch.

In this branch we will use the Gcloud.sh file which is do all the things we do , it means all the command which we use to create,run,delete the project etc. Now those all command i stored in 1 file and if will run only that file than that file will run all the command automatically.

So just run ont file and you will get creating,  running, build api, deploy to google cloud, tests with postman and all the things with this command

```
bash Gcloud.sh
```
